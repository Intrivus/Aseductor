# Aseprite-Compiler
A simple batch script with jsut copy and paste to compile aseprite automatically.
(I'll update this so that you don't need to install source code)

# Setup
Install Visual Studio and dependencies as mentioned in https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/INSTALL.md
Install Skia and Aseprite source code
Put Skia and Aseprite in a folder in Downloads named "Compressed"
Create a folder named "Skia Windows" and a folder named "Aseprite" in "Compressed"
- In "Skia Windows" create a new folder named "skia" then extract skia source code in there
- In "Aseprite" extract Aseprite source code in

**Important**
Run the script as Admin else it won't copy the file

I'll make a video soon although this is only a very simple batch script :D

# Others
- The script automatically compile aseprite in C:/aseprite/build/bin
- You can delete the deps or the aseprite folder in C:/ after finish compiling if you already moved the program
- Remember to keep "Skia Windows" folder for future updates and you could delete Aseprite source code
