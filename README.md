# Aseprite-Compiler

# Setup
Install Visual Studio and dependencies as mentioned in https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/INSTALL.md
Install Skia and Aseprite source code
Put Skia and Aseprite in a folder in Downloads named "Compressed"
Create a folder named "Skia Windows" and a folder named "Aseprite" in "Compressed"
- In "Skia Windows" create a new folder named "skia" then extract skia source code in there
- In "Aseprite" extract Aseprite source code in
(Remember to only extract the file and stuff of the source code and not the whole folder)

I'll make a video soon although this is only a very simple batch script :D
